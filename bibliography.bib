  author={Wu, Chunhung},
  booktitle={EGU General Assembly Conference},
  year={2015},
 abstract={The research built the original logistic regression landslide susceptibility model (abbreviated as or-LRLSM) and landslide ratio-based ogistic regression landslide susceptibility model (abbreviated as lr-LRLSM), compared the performance and explained the error source of two models. The research assumes that the performance of the logistic regression model can be better if the distribution of landslide ratio and weighted value of each variable is similar. Landslide ratio is the ratio of landslide area to total area in the specific area and an useful index to evaluate the seriousness of landslide disaster in Taiwan. The research adopted the landside inventory induced by 2009 Typhoon Morakot in the Chishan watershed, which was the most serious disaster event in the last decade, in Taiwan. The research adopted the 20 m grid as the basic unit in building the LRLSM, and six variables, including elevation, slope, aspect, geological formation, accumulated rainfall, and bank erosion, were included in the two models. The six variables were divided as continuous variables, including elevation, slope, and accumulated rainfall, and categorical variables, including aspect, geological formation and bank erosion in building the or-LRLSM, while all variables, which were classified based on landslide ratio, were categorical variables in building the lr-LRLSM. Because the count of whole basic unit in the Chishan watershed was too much to calculate by using commercial software, the research took random sampling instead of the whole basic units. The research adopted equal proportions of landslide unit and not landslide unit in logistic regression analysis. The research took 10 times random sampling and selected the group with the best Cox & Snell R2 value and Nagelkerker R2 value as the database for the following analysis. Based on the best result from 10 random sampling groups, the or-LRLSM (lr-LRLSM) is significant at the 1% level with Cox & Snell R2 = 0.190 (0.196) and Nagelkerke R2 = 0.253 (0.260). The unit with the landslide susceptibility value > 0.5 (鈮0.5) will be classified as a predicted landslide unit (not landslide unit). The AUC, i.e. the area under the relative operating characteristic curve, of or-LRLSM in the Chishan watershed is 0.72, while that of lr-LRLSM is 0.77. Furthermore, the average correct ratio of lr-LRLSM (73.3%) is better than that of or-LRLSM (68.3%). The research analyzed in detail the error sources from the two models. In continuous variables, using the landslide ratio-based classification in building the lr-LRLSM can let the distribution of weighted value more similar to distribution of landslide ratio in the range of continuous variable than that in building the or-LRLSM. In categorical variables, the meaning of using the landslide ratio-based classification in building the lr-LRLSM is to gather the parameters with approximate landslide ratio together. The mean correct ratio in continuous variables (categorical variables) by using the lr-LRLSM is better than that in or-LRLSM by 0.6 ~ 2.6% (1.7% ~ 6.0%). Building the landslide susceptibility model by using landslide ratio-based classification is practical and of better performance than that by using the original logistic regression.},

Using these factors, landslide susceptibility indexes were calculated by likelihood ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural network models. Before the calculation, the study area was divided into two sides (west and east) of equal area, for verification of the models. Thus, the west side was used to assess the landslide susceptibility, and the east side was used to verify the derived susceptibility.

With increasing sophistication of GIS-based statistical methods, however, landslide susceptibility studies benefit from the integration of data collected from various sources and methods at different scales. This study presents a logistic regression method for landslide susceptibility mapping and verifies the result by comparing it with the geotechnical-based slope stability probability classification (SSPC) methodology. The study was carried out in a landslide-prone national highway road section in the northern Himalayas, India. Logistic regression model performance was assessed by the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve, showing an area under the curve equal to 0.83. Field validation of the SSPC results showed a correspondence of 72% between the high and very high susceptibility classes with present landslide occurrences. A spatial comparison of the two susceptibility maps revealed the significance of the geotechnical-based SSPC method as 90% of the area classified as high and very high susceptible zones by the logistic regression method corresponds to the high and very high class in the SSPC method. On the other hand, only 34% of the area classified as high and very high by the SSPC method falls in the high and very high classes of the logistic regression method. The underestimation by the logistic regression method can be attributed to the generalisation made by the statistical methods, so that a number of slopes existing in critical equilibrium condition might not be classified as high or very high susceptible zones.},

Landslide susceptibility maps were produced using each of the three methods and then compared and validated. Before the modeling and validation, the observed landslides were separated into two groups. The first group was for training, and the other group was for validation steps. The accuracy of models was measured by fitting them to a validation set of observed landslides. For validation process, the area under curvature (AUC) approach was applied. According to the AUC values of 0.810, 0.764, and 0.710 for logistic regression, likelihood ratio, and multi-criteria decision analysis, respectively, logistic regression was determined to be the most accurate method among the other used landslide susceptibility mapping methods.

In this study, we presented an approach for the analysis and modeling of landslide data using rare events logistic regression and applied the approach to an area in Lianyungang, China. Digital orthophotomaps, digital elevation models of the region, geological maps and different GIS layers including settlement, road net and rivers were collected and applied in the analysis. Landslides were identified by monoscopic manual interpretation and validated during the field investigation. To validate the quality of mapping, the data from the study area were divided into a training set and validation set. The result map showed that 4.26% of the study area was identified as having very high susceptibility to landslides, whereas the others were classified as having very low susceptibility (47.2%), low susceptibility (22.21%), medium susceptibility (14.39%) and high susceptibility (11.93%). The quality of the landslide-susceptibility map produced in this paper was validated, and it can be used for planning protective and mitigation measures. The landslide-susceptibility map is a fundamental part of the Lianyungang city landslide risk assessment.},

Twenty independent variables were used as predictors, including lithology as a categorical variable. Two sets of random samples were used, for a total of 90 model replicates (with and without lithology, and with different proportions of positive and negative data). The model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic.

 abstract={Geospatial database creation for landslide susceptibility mapping is often an almost inhibitive activity. This has been the reason that for quite some time landslide susceptibility analysis was modelled on the basis of spatially related factors. This paper presents the use of frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and multivariate regression models for landslide susceptibility mapping on Cameron catchment area, Malaysia, using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. Landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs, high resolution satellite images, inventory reports and field surveys. Topographical, geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing tools. There were nine factors considered for landslide susceptibility mapping and the frequency ratio coefficient for each factor was computed. The factors chosen that influence landslide occurrence were: topographic slope, topographic aspect, topographic curvature and distance from drainage, all from the topographic database; lithology and distance from lineament, taken from the geologic database; land cover from TM satellite image; the vegetation index value from Landsat satellite images; and precipitation distribution from meteorological data. Using these factors the fuzzy membership values were calculated. Then fuzzy operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values for landslide susceptibility mapping. Further, multivariate logistic regression model was applied for the landslide susceptibility. Finally, the results of the analyses were verified using the landslide location data and compared with the frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and multivariate logistic regression models. The validation results showed that the frequency ratio model (accuracy is 89%) is better in prediction than fuzzy logic (accuracy is 84%) and logistic regression (accuracy is 85%) models. Results show that, among the fuzzy operators, in the case with “gamma” operator (λ = 0.9) showed the best accuracy (84%) while the case with “or” operator showed the worst accuracy (69%).},

 abstract={Landslides are one of the most frequent and common natural hazards in Malaysia. Preparation of landslide susceptibility maps is one of the first and most important steps in the landslide hazard mitigation. However, due to complex nature of landslides, producing a reliable susceptibility map is not easy. For this reason, a number of different approaches have been used, including direct and indirect heuristic approaches, deterministic, probabilistic, statistical, and data mining approaches. Moreover, these landslides can be systematically assessed and mapped through a traditional mapping framework using geoinformation technologies. Since the early 1990s, several mathematical models have been developed and applied to landslide hazard mapping using geographic information system (GIS). Among various approaches, fuzzy logic relation for mapping landslide susceptibility is one of the techniques that allows to describe the role of each predisposing factor (landslide-conditioning parameters) and their optimal combination. This paper presents a new attempt at landslide susceptibility mapping using fuzzy logic relations and their cross application of membership values to three study areas in Malaysia using a GIS. The possibility of capturing the judgment and the modeling of conditioning factors are the main advantages of using fuzzy logic. These models are capable to capture the conditioning factors directly affecting the landslides and also the inter-relationship among them. In the first stage of the study, a landslide inventory was complied for each of the three study areas using both field surveys and airphoto studies. Using total 12 topographic and lithological variables, landslide susceptibility models were developed using the fuzzy logic approach. Then the landslide inventory and the parameter maps were analyzed together using the fuzzy relations and the landslide susceptibility maps produced. Finally, the prediction performance of the susceptibility maps was checked by considering field-verified landslide locations in the studied areas. Further, the susceptibility maps were validated using the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) success rate curves. The ROC curve technique is based on plotting model sensitivity鈥攖rue positive fraction values calculated for different threshold values versus model specificity鈥攖rue negative fraction values on a graph. The ROC curves were calculated for the landslide susceptibility maps obtained from the application and cross application of fuzzy logic relations. Qualitatively, the produced landslide susceptibility maps showed greater than 82% landslide susceptibility in all nine cases. The results indicated that, when compared with the landslide susceptibility maps, the landslides identified in the study areas were found to be located in the very high and high susceptibility zones. This shows that as far as the performance of the fuzzy logic relation approach is concerned, the results appeared to be quite satisfactory, the zones determined on the map being zones of relative susceptibility.},

 abstract={Landslides are very common natural problems in the Selangor area of Malaysia due to the improper use of landcover and tropical rainfall. There are many landslide susceptibility analyses such as statistical, bivariate and data mining approaches exist in the literature. This paper presents the use of fuzzy logic relations for landslide susceptibility mapping on part of Selangor area, Malaysia, using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. At first, landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images, supported by extensive field surveys. Topographic and geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Thirteen landslide conditioning factors such as slope gradient, slope exposure, plan curvature, altitude, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance from drainage, distance from road, lithology, distance from faults, soil, landcover and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) were extracted from the spatial database. These factors were analyzed using fuzzy logic relations to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. Using the landslide conditioning factors and the identified landslides, the fuzzy membership values were calculated. Then fuzzy algebraic operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values for landslide susceptibility mapping. Finally, the ROC curves for all landslide susceptibility models were drawn and the area under curve values were calculated. Landslide locations were used to validate results of the landslide susceptibility maps and the validation results showed 94% accuracy for the fuzzy gamma operator employing all parameters produced in the present study as the landslide conditioning factors. Results showed that, among the fuzzy relations, in the case in which the gamma operator (位 =聽 0.975) showed the best accuracy (94.73%) while the case in which the fuzzy algebraic Or was applied showed the worst accuracy (84.76%). The landslide susceptibility maps produced by the fuzzy gamma operators shows similar trends as those obtained by applying logistic regression procedure by the same author and indicate that fuzzy relations results perform slightly better than the earlier method. Qualitatively, the model yields reasonable results which can be used for preliminary land-use planning purposes.},

 abstract={This paper presents an expert knowledge-based approach to landslide susceptibility mapping in an effort to overcome the deficiencies of data-driven approaches. The proposed approach consists of three generic steps: (1) extraction of knowledge on the relationship between landslide susceptibility and predisposing factors from domain experts, (2) characterization of predisposing factors using GIS techniques, and (3) prediction of landslide susceptibility under fuzzy logic. The approach was tested in two study areas in China — the Kaixian study area (about 250 km 2 ) and the Three Gorges study area (about 4600 km 2 ). The Kaixian study area was used to develop the approach and to evaluate its validity. The Three Gorges study area was used to test both the portability and the applicability of the developed approach for mapping landslide susceptibility over large study areas. Performance was evaluated by examining if the mean of the computed susceptibility values at landslide sites was statistically different from that of the entire study area. A z -score test was used to examine the statistical significance of the difference. The computed z  for the Kaixian area was 3.70 and the corresponding p -value was less than 0.001. This suggests that the computed landslide susceptibility values are good indicators of landslide occurrences. In the Three Gorges study area, the computed z  was 10.75 and the corresponding p -value was less than 0.001.

Landslide density was about three times higher in areas of very high susceptibility than that in the moderate susceptibility areas, and more than twice as high as that in the high susceptibility areas.

 abstract={This paper presents an expert knowledge-based approach to landslide susceptibility mapping in an effort to overcome the deficiencies of data-driven approaches. The proposed approach consists of three generic steps: (1) extraction of knowledge on the relationship between landslide susceptibility and predisposing factors from domain experts, (2) characterization of predisposing factors using GIS techniques, and (3) prediction of landslide susceptibility under fuzzy logic. The approach was tested in two study areas in China — the Kaixian study area (about 250km2) and the Three Gorges study area (about 4600km2). The Kaixian study area was used to develop the approach and to evaluate its validity. The Three Gorges study area was used to test both the portability and the applicability of the developed approach for mapping landslide susceptibility over large study areas. Performance was evaluated by examining if the mean of the computed susceptibility values at landslide sites was statistically different from that of the entire study area. A z-score test was used to examine the statistical significance of the difference. The computed z for the Kaixian area was 3.70 and the corresponding p-value was less than 0.001. This suggests that the computed landslide susceptibility values are good indicators of landslide occurrences. In the Three Gorges study area, the computed z was 10.75 and the corresponding p-value was less than 0.001.

 abstract={Landslide is one of the major natural disasters which cause extensive loss of life and property. During the last three decades, different researchers have developed different methodologies to prepare landslide susceptibility mapping and hazard assessment in the world. The main goal of this paper is to apply a fuzzy logic approach to landslide susceptibility mapping in the Garuwa sub-basin area, East Nepal. Eight different causative factors are considered: slope angle, slope aspect, slope shape, relative relief, distance from drainage, land use, geology, and distance from active faults. Likelihood ratios are obtained for each class of causative factors by comparison with past landslide occurrences. Then, the likelihood ratios are normalized between zero and one to obtain fuzzy membership values. Next, different fuzzy operators are applied to generate landslide susceptibility maps. Comparison with the landslide inventory map reveals that the fuzzy gamma ( 位 ) operator with a 位 -value of 0.70 yields the best prediction accuracy which is then used to produce the final landslide susceptibility zonation map.},

The GIS techniques were used to derive spatial data characterizing the environmental conditions under which landslides occur. An inference technique constructed under fuzzy logic combines the spatial data on environmental conditions with knowledge of landslide-environment relationships to compute the landslide susceptibility of a location. A case study over a small watershed in the Three Gorges area was conducted to evaluate the validity of this approach. The case study showed that the computed susceptibility values are much higher over areas with landslides than areas without landslides. Thus, we conclude that the approach is capable of capturing landslide susceptibility. However, the accuracy of the computed susceptibility depends on the quality of knowledge on landslide-environment relationships and the ability of GIS in characterizing the environment conditions needed.},

However, due to complex nature of landslides, producing a reliable susceptibility map is not easy. For this reason, many procedures have been used to produce such maps. Among various models this paper discusses the effectiveness of fuzzy logic approach for landslide hazard mapping. In this study a new attempt is tried to produce landslide susceptibility map of Karaj Dam Basin in Iran. To obtain the fuzzy relations for producing the susceptibility map, a landslide inventory database is compiled by both field surveys and airphoto studies. The factor maps were input into a GIS and a modified landslide hazard evaluation factor (MLHEF) rating and fuzzy membership functions as well as belief function values were assessed for each class of the factor maps. According to this map, 10% of the study area is classified as very high susceptibility, 23% as high susceptibility, 38% as moderate susceptibility, 4.5% as low susceptibility and 0.5% as very low susceptibility or nonsusceptible areas .the results show that the fuzzy set theory can integrate effectively various spatial data for landslide hazard mapping, and it is expected that some suggestions in this study are helpful to further real applications including integration, and interpretation stages in order to obtain a decision 鈥supporting layer.},

The experiments showed that Support Vector Machines outperformed the other proposed methods, and hence this algorithm was selected as the model of choice to be compared with a common knowledge-driven method – the Analytical Hierarchy Process – to create a landslide susceptibility map of the relevant area. The SVM classifier outperformed the AHP approach in all evaluation metrics (κ index, area under ROC curve and false positive rate in stable ground class).},

 abstract={Data collection for landslide susceptibility modeling is often an inhibitive activity. This is one reason why for quite some time landslides have been described and modelled on the basis of spatially distributed values of landslide-related attributes. This paper presents landslide susceptibility analysis in the Klang Valley area, Malaysia, using back-propagation artificial neural network model. A landslide inventory map with a total of 398 landslide locations was constructed using the data from various sources. Out of 398 landslide locations, 318 (80%) of the data taken before the year 2004 was used for training the neural network model and the remaining 80 (20%) locations (post-2004 events) were used for the accuracy assessment purpose. Topographical, geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Eleven landslide occurrence related factors were selected as: slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, altitude, distance to roads, distance to rivers, lithology, distance to faults, soil type, landcover and the normalized difference vegetation index value. For calculating the weight of the relative importance of each factor to the landslide occurrence, an artificial neural network method was developed. Each thematic layer's weight was determined by the back-propagation training method and landslide susceptibility indices (LSI) were calculated using the trained back-propagation weights. To assess the factor effects, the weights were calculated three times, using all 11 factors in the first case, then recalculating after removal of those 4 factors that had the smallest weights, and thirdly after removal of the remaining 3 least influential factors. The effect of weights in landslide susceptibility was verified using the landslide location data. It is revealed that all factors have relatively positive effects on the landslide susceptibility maps in the study. The validation results showed sufficient agreement between the computed susceptibility maps and the existing data on landslide areas. The distribution of landslide susceptibility zones derived from ANN shows similar trends as those obtained by applying in GIS-based susceptibility procedures by the same authors (using the frequency ratio and logistic regression method) and indicates that ANN results are better than the earlier method. Among the three cases, the best accuracy (94%) was obtained in the case of the 7 factors weight, whereas 11 factors based weight showed the worst accuracy (91%).},

 abstract={Landslide hazard mapping is often performed through the identification and analysis of hillslope instability factors, usually managed as thematic data within geographic information systems (GIS). In heuristic approaches, these factors are rated by the attribution of scores based on the assumed role played by each of them in controlling the development of a sliding process. Other more refined methods, based on the principle that the present and the past are keys to the future, have also been developed, thus allowing less subjective analyses in which landslide susceptibility is assessed by statistical relationships between past landslide events and hillslope instability factors. The objective of this research is to define a method with the ability to forecast landslide susceptibility through the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The Riomaggiore catchment, a subwatershed of the Reno River basin located in the Northern Apennines (Italy), was chosen as an ideal test site, as it is representative of many of the geomorphological settings within this region. In the present application, two different ANNs, used in classification problems, were set up and applied: one belonging to the category of Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) and the other to the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) family. The hillslope factors that have been taken into account in the analysis were the following: (a) lithology, (b) slope angle, (c), profile curvature, (d) land cover and (e) upslope contributing area. These factors have been classified on nominal scales, and their intersection allowed 3342 homogeneous domains (Unique Condition Unit, UCU) to be singled out, which correspond to the terrain units utilized in this analysis. The model vector used to train the ANNs is a subset of that derived from the production of Unique Condition Units and consists of 3342 records organized in input and output variable vectors. In particular, the hillslope factors, once classified on nominal scales as binary numbers, represent the 19 input variables, while the presence/absence of a landslide in a given terrain unit is assumed to be the output variable. The comparison between the most up-to-date landslide inventory of the Riomaggiore catchment and the hazardous areas, as predicted by the ANNs, showed satisfactory results (with a slight preference for the MLP). For this reason, this is an encouraging preliminary approach towards a systematic introduction of ANN-based statistical methods in landslide hazard assessment and mapping.},

As in previous years, in 2001 due to heavy rainfall there were many landslides resulting in damage and human casualties. There is still a great danger of further landslides in the region. Therefore, it is vitally important to prepare a landslide susceptibility map of the region. In this study, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), the statistical index (Wi), and weighting factor (Wf) methods were used to produce and later compare three susceptibility maps. For this purpose, thematic layers including landslide inventory, lithology-weathering, slope, aspect, land cover, distance to stream, drainage density, and distance to road were used. In this study area, 98% of landslides occurred in highly or completely weathered units. Lithology-weathering, land cover, and slope data layers were found to be important factors in the study area. To confirm the practicality of the three susceptibility maps were compared with a landslide activity map containing 16 active landslide zones. The outcome was that the active landslide zones do not completely fit into the high and very high susceptibility classes. But 81.3% of these landslide zones fall into the high and very high susceptibility zones of the AHP method while this is 62.5% in the case of Wi method, and 68.8% with the Wf method. In spite of the results obtained in this study, the development of a susceptibility map is usually determined by the needs and available resources. The results showed that the AHP method gave a more realistic picture of the actual distribution of landslide susceptibility, than the Wi and Wf methods.},

 abstract={The current research presents a detailed landslide susceptibility mapping study by binary logistic regression, analytical hierarchy process, and statistical index models and an assessment of their performances. The study area covers the north of Tehran metropolitan, Iran. When conducting the study, in the first stage, a landslide inventory map with a total of 528 landslide locations was compiled from various sources such as aerial photographs, satellite images, and field surveys. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly split into a testing dataset 70 % (370 landslide locations) for training the models, and the remaining 30 % (158 landslides locations) was used for validation purpose. Twelve landslide conditioning factors such as slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, normalized difference vegetation index, land use, lithology, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from faults, stream power index, and slope-length were considered during the present study. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using binary logistic regression (BLR), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and statistical index (SI) models in ArcGIS. The validation dataset, which was not used in the modeling process, was considered to validate the landslide susceptibility maps using the receiver operating characteristic curves and frequency ratio plot. The validation results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for three mentioned models vary from 0.7570 to 0.8520 . Also, plot of the frequency ratio for the four landslide susceptibility classes of the three landslide susceptibility models was validated our results. Hence, it is concluded that the binary logistic regression model employed in this study showed reasonably good accuracy in predicting the landslide susceptibility of study area. Meanwhile, the results obtained in this study also showed that the statistical index model can be used as a simple tool in the assessment of landslide susceptibility when a sufficient number of data are obtained.},

Therefore, high-performance-based landslide prediction models are useful to government institutions for developing strategies for landslide hazard prevention and mitigation. Development of data mining based algorithms shows that high-performance models can be obtained using ensemble frameworks. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and compare the use of current state-of-the-art ensemble techniques, such as AdaBoost, Bagging, and Rotation Forest, for landslide susceptibility assessment with the base classifier of J48 Decision Tree (JDT). The Guangchang district (Jiangxi province, China) was selected as the case study. Firstly, a landslide inventory map with 237 landslide locations was constructed; the landslide locations were then randomly divided into a ratio of 70/30 for the training and validating models. Secondly, fifteen landslide conditioning factors were prepared, such as slope, aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), plan curvature, profile curvature, lithology, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall. Relief-F with the 10-fold cross-validation method was applied to quantify the predictive ability of the conditioning factors and for feature selection. Using the JDT and its three ensemble techniques, a total of four landslide susceptibility models were constructed. Finally, the overall performance of the resulting models was assessed and compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and statistical indexes. The result showed that all landslide models have high performance (AUC聽>聽0.8). However, the JDT with the Rotation Forest model presents the highest prediction capability (AUC聽=聽0.855), followed by the JDT with the AdaBoost (0.850), the Bagging (0.839), and the JDT (0.814), respectively.

 abstract={The objective of this research is introduce a new machine learning ensemble approach that is a hybridization of Bagging ensemble (BE) and Logistic Model Trees (LMTree), named as BE-LMtree, for improving the performance of the landslide susceptibility model. The LMTree is a relatively new machine learning algorithm that was rarely explored for landslide study, whereas BE is an ensemble framework that has proven highly efficient for landslide modeling. Upper Reaches Area of Red River Basin (URRB) in Northwest region of Viet Nam was employed as a case study. For this work, a GIS database for the URRB area has been established, which contains a total of 255 landslide polygons and eight predisposing factors i.e., slope, aspect, elevation, land cover, soil type, lithology, distance to fault, and distance to river. The database was then used to construct and validate the proposed BE-LMTree model. Quality of the final BE-LMTree model was checked using confusion matrix and a set of statistical measures. The result showed that the performance of the proposed BE-LMTree model is high with the classification accuracy is 93.81% on the training dataset and the prediction capability is 83.4% on the on the validation dataset. When compared to the support vector machine model and the LMTree model, the proposed BE-LMTree model performs better; therefore, we concluded that the BE-LMTree could prove to be a new efficient tool that should be used for landslide modeling. This research could provide useful results for landslide modeling in landslide prone areas.},

 abstract={The main objective of this study is to propose and verify a novel ensemble methodology that could improve prediction performances of landslide susceptibility models. The proposed methodology is based on the functional tree classifier and three current state-of-the art machine learning ensemble frameworks, Bagging, AdaBoost, and MultiBoost. According to current literature, these methods have been rarely used for the modeling of rainfall-induced landslides. The corridor of the National Road 32 (Vietnam) was selected as a case study. In the first stage, the landslide inventory map with 262 landslide polygons that occurred during the last 20 years was constructed and then was randomly partitioned into a ratio of 70/30 for training and validating the models. Second, ten landslide conditioning factors were prepared such as slope, aspect, relief amplitude, topographic wetness index, topographic shape, distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to faults, lithology, and rainfall. The model performance was assessed and compared using the receiver operating characteristic and statistical evaluation measures. Overall, the FT with Bagging model has the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.917), followed by the FT with MultiBoost model (AUC = 0.910), the FT model (AUC = 0.898), and the FT with AdaBoost model (AUC = 0.882). Compared with those derived from popular methods such as J48 decision trees and artificial neural networks, the performance of the FT with Bagging model is better. Therefore, it can be concluded that the FT with Bagging is promising and could be used as an alternative in landslide susceptibility assessment. The result in this study is useful for land use planning and decision making in landslide prone areas.},

 abstract={The Synthetic Minority Over Sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is a widely used technique to balance imbalanced data. In this paper we focus on improving SMOTE in the presence of class noise. Many improvements of SMOTE have been proposed, mostly cleaning or improving the data after applying SMOTE. Our approach differs from these approaches by the fact that it cleans the data before applying SMOTE, such that the quality of the generated instances is better. After applying SMOTE we also carry out data cleaning, such that instances (original or introduced by SMOTE) that badly fit in the new dataset are also removed. To this goal we propose two prototype selection techniques both based on fuzzy rough set theory. The first fuzzy rough prototype selection algorithm removes noisy instances from the imbalanced dataset, the second cleans the data generated by SMOTE. An experimental evaluation shows that our method improves existing preprocessing methods for imbalanced classification, especially in the presence of noise.},

 abstract={Learning from data sets that contain very few instances of the minority class usually produces biased classifiers that have a higher predictive accuracy over the majority class, but poorer predictive accuracy over the minority class. SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique) is specifically designed for learning from imbalanced data sets. This paper presents a modified approach (MSMOTE) for learning from imbalanced data sets, based on the SMOTE algorithm. MSMOTE not only considers the distribution of minority class samples, but also eliminates noise samples by adaptive mediation. The combination of MSMOTE and AdaBoost are applied to several highly and moderately imbalanced data sets. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of MSMOTE is better than SMOTEBoost in the minority class and F-values are also improved.},

 abstract={The wrapper feature selection approach is useful in identifying informative feature subsets from high-dimensional datasets. Typically, an inductive algorithm “wrapped” in a search algorithm is used to evaluate the merit of the selected features. However, significant bias may be introduced when dealing with highly imbalanced dataset. That is, the selected features may favour one class while being less useful to the adverse class. In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based wrapper approach for feature selection from data with highly imbalanced class distribution. The key idea is to create multiple balanced datasets from the original imbalanced dataset via sampling, and subsequently evaluate feature subsets using an ensemble of base classifiers each trained on a balanced dataset. The proposed approach provides a unified framework that incorporates ensemble feature selection and multiple sampling in a mutually beneficial way. The experimental results indicate that, overall, features selected by the ensemble-based wrapper are significantly better than those selected by wrappers with a single inductive algorithm in imbalanced data classification.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {In many parts of the world, landslide susceptibility remains inadequately mapped, due to the lack of both data and suitable methods for widespread implementation. Iran is one of those countries with extensive landslide problems, with nearly 4900 large landslides occurring between 1993 and 2007. At the same time landslide susceptibility has not been assessed for the country. Random forest (RF) has recently been shown to be a suitable tool for such mapping. In this study we further coupled the RF method with an evidential belief function (EBF) approach, and tested the suitability for landslide susceptibility mapping for variable terrain and data conditions in the west of Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. Locations of earlier landslides were identified by interpreting aerial photographs and through extensive field surveys. Eleven conditioning factors were used in the RF model. The spatial relationship between landslide occurrence and conditioning factors was then assessed using the data-driven EBF model, and EBF values paired to each map. Finally, the EBF maps were used for running the RF model. Finally, the efficiency of the RF-EBF model was tested using the area under the curve to measure the success and prediction rates of the incorporated data. This resulted in a success rate of 85.2 {\%}, and a prediction rate of 81.8 {\%}. The most important conditioning factors identified were lithology, altitude, distance from roads, and land use, respectively. Based on the overall assessment, the combined RF and EBF approach was found to be objective and an applicable estimator that improves the predictive accuracy and controls for overfitting, and thus useful for landslide susceptibility mapping at regional scales.},
